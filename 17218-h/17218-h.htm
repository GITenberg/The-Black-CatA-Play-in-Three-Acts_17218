<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface" />Preface.</h2>


<p>Mr. Grein has asked me to write a preface to <span class="smcap">The Black Cat</span>.
I cannot myself see much occasion for this. Why should an author be
called upon to make a speech before the curtain? Because, I presume,
people want to have something to talk about besides the play itself,
and an author must surely have &quot;views.&quot; Well, it is a day of
views&mdash;and of talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Black Cat</span> was produced at the Opera Comique on December
8th, 1893, at one of the Independent Theatre Society's performances.
It had a certain <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i> before a special audience, for
whom, however, it was not written; and it has not been performed
since.</p>

<p>The critics were wonderfully kind. They actually praised the play;
some reluctantly, some with a reckless enthusiasm which quite
astonished me. I had expected a much less pleasant reception.</p>

<p>The main objection they made to the thing was that it had a tragic
ending, which they kindly suggested I had tacked on to my comedy, to
appeal to the morbid taste of an &quot;Independent&quot; audience.
Unfortunately I had done nothing of the kind. The play was conceived
before the Independent Theatre had come into existence. The end was
foreseen from the beginning; the tragedy being implicit in the
subject. The tragic motive lay deeper than the death of the heroine,
who might have been allowed to live, if that last symbolic pageantry
had not had its dramatic fitness. Given the characters and the
circumstances, the end is the absolutely right one.</p>

<p>Of course the circumstances might have been altered, and a sort of
reconciliation patched up between husband and wife. But this would
be a somewhat flat piece of cynicism, only justifiable on the ground
taken by the <i>Telegraph</i>, that modern actors cannot play, and ought
not to be expected to play, modern tragedy.</p>

<p>The conventional &quot;happy ending&quot; demanded by sentimental critics to
suit the taste of sentimental playgoers, the divided parents left
weeping in each other's arms over the recovered child, would also be
quite possible. But surely even a modern dramatist may for once be
allowed to preserve a grain of respect for nature and dramatic art?
This would be an outrage against both. It would not be decent
comedy, it would be mere burlesque, as sentimentality always is to
the judicious.</p>

<p>The only other alternative I see is the exodus of the wife, with or
without her child; or of the husband, with or without his mistress.
But this would be rank Ibsenism, and outrage British morality, which
would be still more dreadful. Only a &quot;practical dramatist&quot; could cut
the Gordian knot, and at the last moment introduce the erring Mrs.
Tremaine, still charming in the garb of a Sister of Mercy, to bring
down the curtain upon a tableau of Woman returning to her Duty, and
Man to his Morality. And I, alas! am not a &quot;practical dramatist.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, if the play had been an experiment, I might have further
experimented with it, and rehandled its ending. But it was not in
its main lines an experiment. It was a thing seen and felt; and so
it must remain, in its printed form, at least&mdash;&quot;a poor thing,&quot; it
may be, &quot;but mine own!&quot;</p>

<p>After the performance, came the managers, wanting to see the play,
and asking why I had not shown it to them before. Well, it never
occurred to me that any of them would seriously have considered the
production of a piece so far off the ordinary lines. They had not,
like the enterprising Director of the Independent Theatre,
undertaken the dreadful trade of educating the public. As a matter
of fact, they fought shy of a piece in which &quot;the new hysteria&quot; was
studied, and which ended badly, or at least sadly.</p>

<p><i>A Comedy of Sighs</i>, produced at the Avenue last spring, <i>was</i>
really an experiment on the taste of the British public. I wished to
ascertain whether a play depending for its interest rather upon
character and dialogue than upon plot and sensational situations,
would be at first tolerated and afterwards enjoyed by an average
audience. Perhaps the experiment was too audaciously conceived, and
too carelessly conducted, by both author and management. It was
unfortunately vitiated by the presence of a prevalent bacillus, the
British bugbear, in the test-tubes.</p>

<p>The new play was received with inarticulate cries of horror by the
critics. The <i>Telegraph</i> and the <i>World</i>, which had presided in
auspicious opposition over the birth of <span class="smcap">The Black Cat</span>, now
hung terrific in unnatural conjunction in the horoscope of <i>A Comedy
of Sighs</i>. Here was Ibsenism again&mdash;nay, worse than Ibsenism,
Dodoism, Sarah-Grandism, Keynotism, rampant on the English stage!
For had I not most impudently exhibited <i>The Modern Woman</i> upon it?
And although there was no tragedy this time, but beautiful
reconciliation, and return to her Duty at the fall of the curtain,
was she not there, the Abomination of Desolation?</p>

<p>Now we know that the Modern Woman ought not to exist anywhere,
therefore she does <i>not</i> exist, therefore she must be stamped out.
Mrs. Grundy and others have already begun the good work, and have
been diligently stamping her out ever since; with such success that
we may hope she will disappear, with infidelity, Ibsenism, the
struggle for existence, and other such objectionable things.
Meanwhile she has made her <i>d&eacute;but</i>, and may cry: <i>J'y suis, j'y
reste!</i></p>

<p>The <i>Comedy of Sighs</i> was slain, waving its tiny flag in the van of
a forlorn hope; and over its dead body &quot;Arms and the Man,&quot; its
machine-guns volleying pellets of satire, marched to victory.</p>

<p>I do not solace myself with that belief, so comforting to the
unsuccessful, that a play fails merely because of its goodness, or
succeeds merely because it is bad; yet it is evident, I think, that
other things besides its merits or demerits as a piece of dramatic
writing may turn the scale for or against it. <i>A Comedy of Sighs</i>,
with its somewhat &quot;impressionist&quot; sketches of character, and
aberrations from the ordinary type of a &quot;well-made play,&quot; proved to
be &quot;too lightly tempered for so loud a wind&quot; as blows upon British
bugbears&mdash;&quot;Modern Women,&quot; and the like.</p>

<p>And now may I say a few words with regard to some misconceptions on
the part of the critics as to my aim in writing these two plays?
One of them, an enthusiast himself, did me the honour to hail me
as a brother enthusiast, albeit an erring one. Possibly I am. But
I have not been trying to educate the public, which is being educated
past its old standards day by day, without such philanthropic effort
on my part. I have not been trying to write &quot;literary&quot; plays. I
quite agree with those who think that a play must be a play first.
If it be &quot;literature&quot; afterwards, that is an added grace which
gives it a permanent value. If it be not, still it may be a good
play in its day and generation. I have not, for the sake of being
unconventional, deliberately set myself to violate all the received
canons of dramatic art, as practised by the &quot;practical dramatist,&quot;
thus making a convention of unconventionality. Unconventional art is
impossible, and the drama, like other arts, has its conventions. But
conventions change, and new ones are evolved, as new problems in art
and other things&mdash;even morality itself&mdash;come in with each new tide
of the human imagination. The &quot;well-made play&quot; of the day before
yesterday is not a canon for all time, even for the most
conservative playgoer.</p>

<p>No, what I have been trying to do is simply to write a good play. Ah
yes! But what <i>is</i> a good play? The enthusiastic critic has a ready
answer: &quot;The play that succeeds, that has a long run, that has money
in it!&quot; I accept the answer for what it is worth. This potentiality
of money is, like &quot;literature,&quot; an added grace: and it certainly,
in a sense, marks the survival of the fittest. But there are other
standards in the great workshop of the artist, Nature. Even the
plant or play that lives but a short time may cast its seed into the
soil, or imagination, of its day, and, like Banquo, beget a royal
race, though not itself a king.</p>

<p>Now, how does such a play as <span class="smcap">The Black Cat</span> differ from
those we see succeeding on the stage every day? Really not so very
much, after all. It merely accentuates a growing tendency in the
plays of the period to get more of the stuff of life, our every-day
human life, typically upon the stage; with less of the traditional
theatrical-academic element. The &quot;well-made play&quot; has itself
undergone evolution since the days when it was an aphorism that not
what is said but what is done on the stage is the essential thing.
This of course is at once true and false, like every other truism.
Without action there can be no play; and a play may be made fairly
intelligible without a single spoken word, just as a scene from
history or fiction may be quite recognisably depicted in a few
symbolic lines, dots, and dashes, though no single human figure be
decently drawn.</p>

<p>We must not, however, forget that action itself is language. What is
called the action of a play is simply a story told by the movements
of the players. But when we see a man stabbed, or a woman kissed,
our curiosity is excited. We want to know something more about the
people whose actions we see. This, indeed, may be roughly told by
gesture and facial expression, which are themselves language; but,
finally, to understand more than the barest outline of the story, we
are forced to demand words. And the more we are interested in human
nature the more we want to understand the thoughts, emotions,
motives, characters, of the personages in action before us. Hence by
gradual steps have come our latest attempts at studies of complex
characters, in their struggle to solve the problems of life; or what
are objected to as &quot;problem plays.&quot; Well, why object? Every play,
from <i>Charley's Aunt</i> to <i>Hamlet</i>, is a problem play. It is merely a
matter of degree. Every play deals with the struggle of men and
women to solve some problem of life, great or small: to outwit evil
fortune. It may be merely to persuade a couple of pretty girls to
stay to luncheon in your college rooms, when their chaperon has not
turned up. It may be something more important.</p>

<p>The more interest the public and the dramatist take in human
nature&mdash;that is to say, the better developed they are as regards
dramatic sympathy&mdash;the more, rich, vivid, and subtle will be the
play of character and passion, in the drama demanded and produced.
In a word, the less wooden-pated and wooden-hearted they become, the
less mechanical and commonplace will their drama be.</p>

<p>We are slowly emerging from the puppet-show conception of drama. Our
dramatists are beginning to do more than refurbish the old puppets,
and move them about the stage according to the rules of the
&quot;well-made&quot; play. They are not content, like their predecessors, to
leave their characters quite at the mercy of the actor who, in
&quot;creating&quot; them, gave them whatever small resemblance to humanity
they may have possessed. And as the play gains in vitality, the
playwright begins to feel the absolute necessity for writing decent
dialogue&mdash;not mere stage dialect that may be scamped and ranted <i>ad
libitum</i> by the &quot;star&quot; to suit his own taste, or want of it, but
real dialogue, which, while ideally reflecting the colloquial
language of the day, taxes the intelligence and feeling of the actor
to deliver properly.</p>

<p>This means real progress; for the dialogue is the very life of the
play. It alone can bring out the essential import of the situation,
the relation of character to character, at any given moment. An
action, an incident, may have a thousand different shades of meaning
or motive. Language, tone, and gesture give it its precise value.
Plot and situations are at best but the skeleton; character and
emotion are the flesh and blood. The treatment is everything.</p>

<p>We still want more of life, of the vital movements of our own time,
upon the stage; and we shall get it by degrees. Sentimental
melodrama, with its male puppet, who is hero or villain, its female
puppet, who is angel or devil, may still continue to flourish among
us; for it still satisfies the natural craving for romance,
ideality, which the drama is bound to supply. But these things
belong to a decaying phase of romance; and our so-called realism is
but the first wave of a new romantic movement, on the stage as
elsewhere. For when the old ideals become decrepit, we must go back
to nature to get the stuff wherewith to make new ones.</p>

<p>As our dramatists advance with the times, people begin to go to the
theatre to see plays, and not merely an actor in a part. The
&quot;well-made play,&quot; which was a piece of mechanical contrivance into
which the puppets were ingeniously fitted, may some day develop into
a work of art&mdash;a thing born rather than made&mdash;growing up like a
flower in the imagination of the dramatist.</p>

<p>When that day comes, the actor, who used to &quot;create&quot; the part, will
have to be content to let the part create him. The play will make
the actor, not the actor the play; to the great benefit of both play
and actor.</p>

<p>But why be so serious over an art whose end is only to amuse? To
amuse? Yes; but we are not all equally amused by the same things.
There may be forms of humour which tickle some people more
exquisitely than even that magnificent making of tea in an old
gentleman's hat, which convulses the <i>Charley's Aunt</i> audience. And
if amusement be the object of the drama, we must take the word in an
extended sense. I should myself roughly define a good play as one
that, when adequately performed, can hold the attention of an
unprejudiced audience from beginning to end, whether it amuses or
merely interests them. It does not follow that because it may shock,
or even bore, some worthy people it is a bad play. Even farcical
comedy bores some people, with whom I cannot sympathise.</p>

<p>And now, if I have been rather hard upon the &quot;well-made play,&quot; it
must not be assumed that it is because I do not value construction.
I do value it. But it should be vital, not academic, organic, not
mechanical. Still, even mechanical construction is better than none
at all. A play without plot is invertebrate, without bones. It is
at his peril that a dramatist departs from accepted rules, even
those respecting &quot;strong&quot; curtains and &quot;strong&quot; exits, though in
certain cases weak curtains and weak exits may be more really
dramatic. Then, valuable as dialogue is, it may be redundant, and
make a play &quot;flabby.&quot; The actor's rule, that all talk that does not
carry on the action is bad, is worthy of all due respect. &quot;You
literary fellows want to say everything twice over,&quot; was the shrewd
criticism of a stage-manager in a certain case. But an actor is
often so absorbed in his own part that he does not easily estimate
the bearing of any given speech, even his own, upon the whole play.
&quot;Cuts&quot; at rehearsal are not unfrequently found to be too hastily
made. Then, what is the action? Not merely the external incidents,
but the shifting phases of thought, emotion, character, in the
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>. It is these that give the incidents their value,
and so give dramatic interest to the plot, or story. The dialogue
and the incidents are but two phases of the presentment of the
story. The action may be rapid or slow, direct, or with episodes.
All depends upon the treatment; and the play that one audience finds
detestable may delight another.</p>

<p>If <span class="smcap">The Black Cat</span> ever again come to the ordeal of the
footlights, I can only hope that it may find an audience as
sympathetic as that of the Independent Theatre.</p>

<p><i>Scene: Denham's Studio. Large highlight window in sloping roof at
back. Under it, in back wall, door to landing. <span class="smcap">l</span> of the
door the corner is curtained off for model's dressing-room.
<span class="smcap">r</span> of door a large Spanish leather folding screen, which
runs on castors, shuts off from the door the other corner, in which
is a &quot;throne,&quot; pushed up against the wall. Above the &quot;throne&quot; hangs
a large square mirror in a carved black frame. In front of the
&quot;throne&quot; is a light couch of Greek form, without back.</i></p>

<p><i>Fireplace, with chimney-breasts panelled in old oak, and high
overmantel, in which are shelves and cupboards, <span class="smcap">l</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Against <span class="smcap">r</span> wall an old oak cabinet, with carved cornice,
and inlaid panelled doors. Close beside it stands on a pedestal a
bust of Demeter.</i><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a> <i>Near the cabinet, halfway up stage <span class="smcap">r c</span>,
an easel, on which is seen the back of a large picture.</i></p>

<p><i>Beyond the fireplace, and at right angles to it, a large sofa, or
lounge, with square ends and back, broad low seat, loose cushions,
and valance. In front of the fireplace an armchair, with a book face
downward on one arm.</i></p>

<p><i>The walls of the studio are distempered in greenish-blue, the
curtains of the model's dressing-room are in rich yellow plush or
brocade, the couch and sofa covered in greenish-yellow stuffs.</i></p>

<p><i>Various artistic properties, tapestries, embroideries, etc.,
hanging up, or thrown carelessly over Chippendale chairs and the
screen.</i></p>

<p><i>Canvases leaning against the walls, on which hang designs and
figure-studies in chalk and charcoal, with landscape-studies in oil
and watercolour, nailed up without much attempt at arrangement.</i></p>

<p><i>Near the front, just <span class="smcap">r</span> of the armchair, an oblong carved
oak table, with materials for wood-drawing, paint-box, water in a
tumbler, etc., is set end on to the footlights.</i></p>

<p><i>At the upper end of this table Undine is discovered, as she sits
with a slate and arithmetic book before her, her elbows on the
table, her head supported on both hands, holding a slate pencil from
which a bit of sponge dangles by a string.</i><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></p>

<p>(<i>pouting</i>) I hate these old sums! Mother's always making me do sums
in the holidays. It isn't fair. Seven times three is&mdash;what's father
reading? (<i>Rises, and takes up the book.</i>) That's French, I know.
Father's always reading French. G.Y.P. Gyp? I wonder what it's
about. (<i>Puts the book down, sits, yawns, and takes up the pencil.</i>)
Seven times three is&mdash;twenty-one. Put down one and carry two. Oh,

(<i>Throws down the pencil; it falls off the table.</i>) Horrid old
things! they're always coming wrong. (<i>She rises lazily, and stoops
to pick up the pencil, then looks round her, stretching her arms and
yawning.</i>) I say, what fun to make a libation to Demeter! I will!
Let's see. I wish I had mother's Greek dress. I must have one of
father's rags. This'll do. (<i>Drapes herself in a piece of
embroidery, runs up stage, jumps on &quot;throne,&quot; and poses before the
mirror.</i>) It's awfully jolly dressing up. But I have no wine. Oh, I
know&mdash;I'll take some of father's painting water&mdash;though it's rather
black-and-whity. (<i>Takes up the glass, and approaches the statue.</i>)
Hail, Demeter! I have no wine for you, but here's some water.
(<i>Makes libation.</i>) I suppose I should pray for something now. Oh, I
do wish you'd stop mother persecuting me in the holidays like this!
But you can't, you dear old thing. Father says the old gods are
dead. I wish they'd come alive again. (<i>Crosses to table.</i>)</p>

<p>No, not now.</p>

<p class="centre">Undine.</p>

<p>The old Greeks were the cleverest people that ever lived, and they
had the nicest gods. Don't you wish there were goddesses now,
father? (<i>Rises, and leans against table.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>absently</i>) Yes, of course.</p>

<p class="centre">Undine.</p>

<p>Goddesses sometimes fell in love with <i>people</i>, father&mdash;didn't they?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>People who didn't happen to be gods? It did occur sometimes, they

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Then you must be taught to know.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>May I say a word? I am chiefly to blame. We were talking about the

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Oh well, if <i>you</i> encourage her in her laziness, I can do nothing.
(<i>Crosses <span class="smcap">l</span> as she speaks, then turns suddenly.</i>) Get out

take off that pinafore. You are a disgrace to your father and to me.
(<i>Gives her a final shake. Undine runs out screaming.</i>) Oh dear! Oh

house with her yells. (<i>She presses her hands over her ears.</i>) Oh,
that child will be the death of me! (<i>Throws herself down upon the

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>sighing</i>) Yes, we are all mistakes from the ideal standpoint.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes, you are an over-populated woman, dear. (<i>Rises up to her.</i>) The
modern woman is very easily over-populated.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>You can joke about it, of course. To me it is a serious calamity.
(<i>Weeps.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Well, dear, at least we have not repeated our initial mistake.
(<i>Crosses to picture.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Do you regret it?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>God forbid! I only regret that our relations were not always
strictly platonic. That is the highest practical ideal of the
age&mdash;modern woman being what she is.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Yes, I know you despise me in your heart. You are always sneering at
me as a modern woman. What do you mean?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>crosses to her</i>) I agree with Michelet: &quot;<i>La femme est une

<p>Phrases, phrases, always phrases! When I am most in earnest you put

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>&quot;If I laugh at any mortal thing, 'tis that I may not weep.&quot;</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>starting up and pacing</i>) Happy? Give me life! Give me life!
Happiness can take care of itself. But there is no use in crying
&quot;Give, give!&quot; like the horse-leech. If we want impossibilities we
must achieve them. (<i>Crosses <span class="smcap">r</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>You want incompatible things.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Of course I do. So do you. Your reason and your instincts are at
war, just like mine. That is our sickness.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>How at war?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Your reason tells you that woman is independent, self-sufficing.
Your instincts cry feebly for passion, that savage outlaw which
still lies in wait for the modern woman, to carry her whither she
would not. Hence your lapse from strict agnostic morality into<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
matrimony, bondage, subjection, and the mistake, Undine.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>That child has come between us. I think children often do.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Is that one of the <i>necessary</i> horrors of matrimony?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Heaven help me, that girl drives me mad!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Nerves, nerves, as usual. She irritates you, and you irritate her.
The mere presence of a child sets your teeth on edge. (<i>Crosses, and

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>My brain has been torn to pieces by children all my life. I was a
slave to my own brothers and sisters, because I was the eldest.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>That was very hard, I know; but your own child is different, surely?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>You seem to think I don't love her?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Not wisely, but too well&mdash;as you love me.</p>

<p>Children <i>are</i> shockingly human, just like you and me. I wish I

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>You have often lost your own temper with her when you have tried to
teach her anything&mdash;often enough. (<i>Sits <span class="smcap">l</span> of table.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes, it was sheer stupidity. It is a bad educational method. It

<p>Furious! (<i>Rises</i>) Thank you for the word. (<i>Crosses <span class="smcap">r</span>.</i>) I

<i>must</i> think of her future.<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>rises, and lights pipe</i>) Oh, damn the future&mdash;and the past too!
You take life too seriously. You are a born self-tormentor, too full
of anxiety to live. You have the worst form of the great malady of
the age, conscience in the agnostic form. You suffer from the new
hysteria.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>I am not hysterical.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Pardon me, we are all hysterical nowadays. We have lost our
self-possession. You don't kick on the hearthrug and that kind of
thing. A bucket of cold water is not &quot;indicated&quot; in your case.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>It seems to me you are always throwing buckets of cold water over
me.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>For heaven's sake, go and reform the world! That is the modern
woman's true vocation&mdash;and cure. Denounce our sensuality and
selfishness from the platform, as well as from the hearth. They are
the defects of our qualities. If you don't like us as we are, mould
us.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>approaching</i>) That is what we are trying to do.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes. You have not mastered your material yet. Your technique is a

his pipe as she comes.</i>)<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>kneeling beside him</i>) Why will you push me away from you, Arthur?
You know I only want to be your wife. You are always implying that
our marriage is a failure. Why not say it directly?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>We are creatures of the transition. We have not quite found the new
centre of equilibrium. Marriage, except as a symbol, is either a
superfluous bond or the consecration of a mistake. You have taught
us this great truth, anyhow.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Why did you get married then?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Practically it is still a necessary evil, like war and politics. The
brute world, howling, forces us into bonds. It is our business to
adjust them so as to gall us as little as possible.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>starting up, crosses <span class="smcap">r</span></i>) If the bonds gall you so much,
break them. Don't spend your breath in this puling talk. If you are
tired of me, go! As far as I am concerned, I set you free. Find some
other woman, if you can, who will be more satisfactory.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>rising, and standing with his back to the fire</i>) But why one other
woman? Why not extend my freedom to two?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Two or a dozen, what is it to me?<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>A dozen, Constance? Do you take me for a Turk? I have often told you
every man should be content with three wives. More than this verges
upon polygamy. But blessed is he who finds the three in one!</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Indeed. Have you found that in Gyp?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>No, not directly; though Gyp fills me with thoughts that do often
lie too deep for tears. Her cynicism is always illuminating.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>I wish I could say the same of yours. But why three, and not a
dozen?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>There are only three possible women in the world, the Divine
Mistress&mdash;</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>And the &quot;Divine Matron&quot;&mdash;I have heard this sickening cant before.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Cant? Philosophy! But don't forget the third, The Divine
Virgin&mdash;Womanhood fashioning itself independently after its own
ideal. She has driven us, naked and ashamed, into the desert of
disillusion.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Truth, truth&mdash;let me have truth, though it kill me! Men are cowards;
they dare not face the naked facts of life.<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Men are poets. Facts are but the crude stuff of life. Imagination is
all.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Oh, if you want romance, had you not better go and look for your
Divine Mistress? Perhaps you may find some ugly truths in her too.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>laughing</i>) One woman is surely enough for the purposes of
disillusion. It is too late to begin sowing one's wild oats. There
are no dangerous women about. If there were one healthy women in the
world&mdash;(<i>Crosses to picture.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>You might have some cause for jealousy.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>You would quit the wreck?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>If it were really a wreck&mdash;perhaps. But why should it be? (<i>He takes

Nature&mdash;or at least Human-nature.</p>

<p>Blanche Tremaine? Who is she?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>My old class-fellow at our college in town. She played in our Greek

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Younger than you?<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Two years. Yes; she must be about eight-and-twenty now. You know I
told you about her. She married a Mr. Overton.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Overton? I seem to have heard the name. Didn't she run away from her
husband, or something?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Yes, poor thing! He led her an awful life.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Oh, and then she married the co-respondent! I remember.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>What an interest you take in these scandals!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Of course, dear. A scandal is a typical case of the great social
disease.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>She promised to be handsome.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>I wonder whether this woman is a weak fool, or a bold experimenter
in the art of life?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>How so?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Why, having had the courage to come down from the cross, should she

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>What cross?<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>What is woman's cross from the foundation of the world but man, man?
The cords are the bonds of marriage, her children are the nails, and
love her crown of thorns.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Very poetical, no doubt.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Bitter truth, as you are never tired of demonstrating to me. Do you
think the unfortunate cross has not had his share of the torment?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Too light a share for his tyranny, cruelty, and, above all, his
<i>mean</i> hypocrisy. May he burn in some spiritual fire for that!</p>

<p>So he does; it runs in his veins. Well, something better may come of

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>You are the only gossip who comes our way.<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></p>

<p>I know this'll interest you awfully. Pottleton Smith's wife's run
away at last. Now wasn't I right? (<i>Looks smilingly at both for

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Poor silly little flirt! I'm very sorry.</p>

<p class="centre">Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>(<i>rubbing his hands</i>) I'm&mdash;I'm awfully glad. It'll be the saving of
poor Smith. Though he's awfully cut up about it, of course.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Did she run away with&mdash;any one in particular?</p>

<p class="centre">Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>A Captain Crosby or Cosby, or something. He's in some horse
regiment, the cavalry or something. He's&mdash;he's an awful scamp, a
blackleg and all that, but an awfully nice fellow. I met him at
Smith's the other day, and they&mdash;they&mdash;they were carrying on all the
time under poor little Smith's nose. (<i>He saunters absently to the

awfully good, you know&mdash;an advance on your last.</p>

<p class="centre">(<i>During this speech Denham also goes to the easel.</i>)<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Don't you think so?</p>

<p class="centre">Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Yes, it's an advance, decidedly. What is it, eh? I forget.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Brynhild.</p>

<p class="centre">Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Oh, Brynhild! The horse is awfully good, you know&mdash;savage and that;
but the woman isn't ugly enough&mdash;at least, you haven't quite got the
right kind of ugliness, eh?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I meant her to be beautiful.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>smiling</i>) And I gave him some sittings, Mr. Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class="centre">Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>(<i>with a genial laugh</i>) Did you, now? Well, he tried to improve on
you&mdash;that was it. (<i>With great conviction to Denham</i>.) But&mdash;but
surely you're wrong in that. Brynhild was an ugly, passionate woman.

character, and character is always ugly.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes, I know what you mean. But I thought&mdash;no, the thing's a failure.

<p>My dear Fitzgerald, when will you learn that you can never know me?
(<i>Crosses to picture</i>.)</p>

<p class="centre">Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Then, my dear Vane, I must learn to be resigned. (<i>Fitzgerald turns

&quot;Autour du Marriage,&quot; eh? (<i>Opens book, and reads, then lies on

<p class="centre">Vane.</p>

<p>Ah, the Brynhild! My dear Denham, why <i>will</i> you do such things?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>What have I done?</p>

<p class="centre">Vane.</p>

<p>Not what you have tried to do&mdash;to paint an epic picture.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Is that wrong?</p>

<p class="centre">Vane.</p>

<p>Worse than wrong; it is a <i>b&ecirc;tise</i>. (<i>Comes to fire, and stands with
his back to it.</i>) You might as well try to write a long poem. Such
things are certainly <i>long</i>, and as certainly not <i>poems</i>. That huge
thing is not a picture.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Ah, you write quatrains. Should no poem exceed four lines?<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Vane.</p>

<p>Not only should not, but in our present state of development,
<i>cannot</i>. The quatrain is the analogue of the Greek gem, the
<i>consummate</i> flower of the national art of the period. It will take
at <i>least</i> a century to perfect and exhaust it. Have you seen my
book, &quot;Three Quatrains&quot;?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>No; have you published it lately?</p>

<p class="centre">Vane.</p>

<p>My dear Denham! I never <i>publish</i> anything. In a wilderness of
mediocrity obscurity is fame.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes, a well-advertised obscurity. But surely you <i>have</i> published
poems?</p>

<p class="centre">Vane.</p>

<p>Where have you lived, my dear fellow? I breathe a poem into the air,
and the world hears. If some one prints it, can I help it? One does
not print, wake, and become famous; one becomes famous, and the
world awakes, cackles, and prints one.</p>

<p class="centre">Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>By-the-bye, Vane, there's a quatrain in your &quot;In the House of
Hathor&quot; I wanted to ask you about.</p>

<p class="centre">Vane.</p>

<p>Which?<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></p>

<p>My dear fellow, look at that canvas. What a method! You are like an

Englishmen make the attempt. You are a nation of amateurs. (<i>He

<p>My brush did it somehow.</p>

<p class="centre">Vane.</p>

<p>Ah! this is exquisite&mdash;or would be if you could paint. Why, <i>why</i>
not learn the technique of your art, and make these notes of a mood,
a moment, so as to give real delight?</p>

<p>Upon my word, Vane, you are right. That sketch is worth a wilderness

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Yes. Fancy a woman making that mistake twice! But, you see, I was in

I don't want to conceal my misdeeds.</p>

<p class="centre">Miss Macfarlane.</p>

<p>Oh, don't expect paving stones from an old woman like me! I judge
every case on its own merits. I know what men are, though I've been
content to gain my experience at my friends' expense. I tell ye I
know more about the ins and outs of marriages than most married
women, just as the curler on the bank sees most of the game. You
mayn't have been anything worse than a fool, and ye mayn't have been
even that.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm in the humour for confession. I think you can understand. We

<p>No&mdash;none.</p>

<p class="centre">Miss Macfarlane.</p>

<p>A woman who has had such unpleasant experiences ought to hate and
despise men. But of course <i>you</i> don't?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>laughing</i>) No&mdash;I don't think I hate men exactly. I despise some
men heartily.</p>

<p class="centre">Miss Macfarlane.</p>

<p>They're gey ill to live wi', eh?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>I don't think marriage suits me, somehow. I suppose it suits some
people. But I think it often tends to reduce them to a dead level of
commonplace. The artificial bond makes people too sure of each
other. It does not do to take love too much for granted, I think.</p>

<p>Quite right. (<i>Rises, and puts log of wood on fire, then stands with

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Thanks. I like to be liked; and I can forgive your want of

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>All right. (<i>He poses her, then goes back to the easel.</i>) By Jove!
this is getting serious. This is the best thing I have done.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>So you say of them all. This is the third attempt. How many more do
you intend to make?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Oh, I don't know! I should like to go on as long as I could make
headway. (<i>He paints in silence for some time.</i>) There, I am getting
something I never got before&mdash;the real woman at last.<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></p>

<p>May I see?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>For Heaven's sake, don't stir! (<i>Paints again.</i>) Blanche!</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Do you know I was a fool, to say you were not beautiful?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>You only spoke the truth.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>It is a higher truth to say you are; and you seem to have grown
<i>more</i> beautiful this last month.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Oh, I am happier now!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Happier?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Yes. You don't know what an oasis this studio has been to me. I
shall be sorry to go back to the desert.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Well, I never had a better model. I have learnt a lot since I began
to paint you.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>I am so glad if I have been of any use. Have you ever painted
Constance?<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>I have tried; but she's a fidgety sitter, and always looks like an
incarnation of despair. (<i>He approaches her.</i>) May I arrange these
folds a little?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>arranging skirt of dress</i>) That will do. The fan so&mdash;head a
<i>little</i> more to the left&mdash;so. (<i>He goes back, and paints in silence
again.</i>) This is coming splendidly. I dare not do much more to the
head.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Can you finish it to-day?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>As much as I can finish anything. (<i>Paints again in silence.</i>) I
wish Constance had some of your reposeful quality. I can't think
what ails her. She gets more irritable and pessimistic every day.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Perhaps you irritate her.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>I? But, good heavens!&mdash;(<i>Stops painting, and looks at her.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Yes, I know. You think you are very patient, while you treat her
with a&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;a sort of contemptuous respect.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Really? I am sorry if it seems so. I wish I could rouse her out of
the slough of despond.<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Perhaps she is disappointed?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>We are all disappointed. It is the niggardliness of Nature&mdash;the old
woman in the shoe. (<i>Paints again in silence.</i>) Do you believe in
love, Blanche? Still?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>sighing</i>) Yes, I think I do. There is not very much else left for
one to believe in, nowadays.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>So do I&mdash;as a dream.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Ah! You are the pessimist now.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Why make mad efforts to realise it?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>A necessity of our nature, I suppose.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>What does the modern woman desire or expect from a man? You are sick
of marriage, it seems.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>As it exists&mdash;yes.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Well, the instinctive <i>amourette</i> had its poetry&mdash;in Arcadia. Keep
your hands quiet a moment.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Let me warm them first. Remember we are in the grip of a London
May.<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>All right&mdash;come. (<i>She comes over to the picture. He stops her.</i>)
No, you must not look yet.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>You have become quite a tyrant, do you know?</p>

<p class="centre">(<i>She goes to the fire.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>taking her hands</i>) Cold? Yes; I have kept you too long. You have
such good hands! I wish I could paint them.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>kneels at fire, and warms her hands</i>) One more chance!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>I shall make the most of it. Well, but what do you want? A
friendship, passionate and Platonic? Why, it takes all the tyranny
of a strong man like Swift to keep instinct within bounds. The
victory killed Stella and Vanessa.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Oh, we are more rational now! Then, there were two of them; that was
the difficulty there.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes, there were two of them. Except in a desert island, there is
always a danger of that.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Why are men so inconstant?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Why are women so charming&mdash;and unsatisfactory? We deceive ourselves,
and are deceived, just like you.<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>You amuse yourselves, and we pay.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>It is the will of God&mdash;of Nature, I should say. She is an artist;
but as for her morality&mdash;</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>One can't say much for that.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Art is Nature's final aim. Love is the Art of Arts, and Art is long.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>But could you not be a <i>little</i> more constant, if you tried?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Oh, <i>we</i> can resist temptation, when we are not tempted&mdash;just like
women.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Your <i>capacity</i> for temptation is wonderful.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes. <i>We</i> know our own frailty, <i>you</i> never quite realise yours.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>What has made you so cynical?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>The bitterness of life. Are your hands warm yet? (<i>Takes her
hands.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Yes, I can go back now.</p>

<p class="centre">(<i>She goes back to the &quot;throne.&quot; He poses her, and returns to the
easel.</i>)<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>painting again</i>) Marriage must certainly be modified. A woman
should have some honourable way of escape, when her husband gets
tired of her.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>laughing</i>) How delicately you put it! But the wife? If you had to
bear all you so chivalrously inflict on us in &quot;honourable&quot; marriage,
I wonder how many marriages there would be?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Instinct would be too strong for us still. But we should outscheme
Nature. We should invent. What has a woman ever invented since the
beginning of the world? Well, you can easily rail us out of
marriage. How will you live then?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>As we are trying to live now.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>I believe woman's great ambition is to do all the work of the world,
and maintain man in idleness.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>That would be awful! You would all be artists and minor poets then.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>You, I believe, prefer &quot;the Free Union,&quot; as it is called, to
marriage?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>If it were practicable.<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Ah yes! We can't live innocently and comfortably in &quot;open sin,&quot;
until the kingdom of heaven comes.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>laughing</i>) No, I fear there are still difficulties. But, after
all, one can do&mdash;well, almost anything; if one does it from
conscientious motives&mdash;and knows one's way about.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes. And how charming the relationship might be made! Women would
really study the art of keeping a lover. But what, in Heaven's name,
is the sympathetic modern man to do, who feels that to love one of
these creatures of a finer clay, in his rough masculine fashion, is
to &quot;insult,&quot; or &quot;enslave,&quot; or injure her, in one way or another? &quot;I
love you, therefore God forbid I should marry you!&quot;&mdash;that is the
newest gospel.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>We are not all such miserable creatures as you imagine. Treat us
decently well, and we can stand a good deal, without whining like
men&mdash;poor persecuted saints!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible to treat you well in this &quot;imperfect

<p>Well, you mysterious creature, I think you have chosen your
profession well. Your voice is lovely, and your style&mdash;well, not bad
in these days of execrable singing.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Do you know, it was your praise that made me think seriously of
this?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>absorbed in painting</i>) Really? But why would you never sing to me
since that evening?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>I have been working so hard; I wanted to surprise you.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>And now you will?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;some time. (<i>A pause, Denham painting in silence.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Come down and look at this thing now. I can do no more to it.<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Oh <i>yes</i>! But how you <i>have</i> flattered me! I shall be reduced to a
proper humility when I look in the glass. (<i>Turns and glances at
mirror, then again at picture.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Never mind the glass. That's how I see you.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>crosses <span class="smcap">c</span> and drops him a curtsey</i>) Thank you, sir. An

Do you ever go to the theatre?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Sometimes.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Does it amuse you?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Oh yes! I like a good three act farce.<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>So do I. But our serious plays are amusing in a deeper way&mdash;now that
we have begun timidly to scratch the surface of things. I wonder, if
you and I were put on the stage, what they would say of us?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>But there is nothing to make a play about in <i>us</i>.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>They would certainly say there was &quot;no situation,&quot; though perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>What <i>is</i> a situation?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Oh, you know&mdash;something threadbare, the outraged husband driving his
erring wife about the stage&mdash;all that sort of thing.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>I love an outraged husband; they are so magnificently moral!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I am on no such pinnacle. (<i>Rises.</i>) I can only humbly
ask you, when will you sit again?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Oh, now that you have painted that masterpiece, I must resign the
privilege of being your model.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>That is unkind of you, Blanche. But why? (<i>Puts his pipe down.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>You can't go on painting <i>me</i> for ever.<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>I <i>shall</i> go on painting you for ever. But you will surely give me
an occasional sitting?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>No; I must be stern. (<i>Rises and crosses <span class="smcap">c</span>.</i>) I must work
seriously now.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>At least you'll come and see us? You'll come and sing the savageness
out of this bear?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>No; I must go back into the desert.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Seriously?</p>

<p>Mrs. Tremaine. Yes.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>I knew it must come to an end, Blanche. (<i>Crosses <span class="smcap">c</span>.</i>)
Well, we have had a good time.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Yes. It has been pleasant here.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>You have been my good genius. Do you know, I was getting sick of it
all before you came?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Sick of what?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Of myself, of art, of life.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>That was foolish. I am glad if I have reconciled you to existence.<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>You have made me alive again, opened a door to new possibilities,

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Well, don't go back into the shadow. (<i>Taking her hat, she goes

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>No. I will go forward.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>That is right; and now I must go. (<i>About to take cloak.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>No, you must not go yet. Come and sit upon your throne once more.
(<i>Mrs. Tremaine stops.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>But you are not going to paint again?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>No. I only want to look at you. Do grant me this last grace! (<i>He

<p>That is the highest praise you could give it; if it be

<p>Say it in verse as much as you like. It does not sound nice in

<p>We can't avoid it, Mrs. Tremaine. To do it with dignity is all that

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>with increased vexation</i>) That's impossible. (<i>Crosses</i>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>As you please. Call it friendship, or anything you like. To me it is
new life. You have simply taken possession of me from the
first&mdash;imagination, heart, soul, everything. I live in you, I see
your face, I hear your voice, I speak to you when you are absent,
just as if you were present. I call you aloud by your name&mdash;Blanche,

<p class="centre">(<i>She starts away from him, and the cloak remains in his hands.</i>)</p>

<p>Hush, hush, Mr. Denham! I ought not to listen to such words from
you. I never dreamed&mdash;</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>throwing cloak over back of sofa</i>) I know, I know. Women never do;
they go on their way like blindfold fates. Is there such a thing as

<p>Don't laugh at my raving, you cruel Blanche! I know it sounds as

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Do let us part friends. If you are in earnest, you must know this is

(<i>Softening.</i>) Perhaps I was to blame, but I meant nothing wrong.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Oh, I acquit you completely! We drifted&mdash;that was all. Jest

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Don't say unkind things to me. I can't bear them, though I suppose I
deserve them. I liked you, and your admiration flattered my vanity;
and I suppose I may have made you think I cared more for you than&mdash;I
did.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Well, you don't love me. What does it matter? <i>I</i> love <i>you</i>; that
is the important thing to me. I thank you for that eternal
possession. Let it be a dream, austere and pure. Passion has its own
ascetic cell, where it can fast and scourge itself. I ask you for
nothing, Blanche. I am yours wholly. Do what you like with me.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Go back to your wife.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;my poor Constance! Well, Blanche, at least you and I can't
utterly spoil each other's lives. We can't <i>marry</i> each other.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Don't say any more. Let us forget all this.<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Forget? No. But we must renounce. You, too, will wear the sackcloth.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>petulantly</i>) Why should <i>I</i> wear sackcloth?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>My dear Blanche, you are not such a fine coquette as you imagine.
(<i>Going close up to her.</i>) Do you think I can't read those beautiful
eyes of yours? You love me! Your love fills the air like the
fragrance of a flower. (<i>He clasps her in his arms.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>impatiently</i>) Suppose I did. <i>Apr&egrave;s?</i></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>You do love me, Blanche? (<i>Kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, it is the eternal tragedy! We must renounce.</p>

<p class="centre">(<i>Half releasing her.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Why must we renounce? Now that you have gone so far, why turn back?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>releasing her</i>) It is the least of evils. How should I hide you
from the world's vile slanders? Let us keep our dream unsullied.

<p>I have been through the fire already, and could face it again&mdash;for a
man I loved, and who loved me.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>But it would scorch you worse than before. Then, Constance!</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>with scorn</i>) Ay, Constance! You ought to have thought of her
before. (<i>Passionately.</i>) Why have you spoken to me? Why have you
compelled <i>me</i> to speak, if you are not bold enough to break the
bonds that are strangling you?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Because I must. Don't tempt me, Blanche. We shall sometimes meet,
look in each other's eyes, and keep our secret. It is best so. I
love you so much that I would save you from yourself.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>I don't understand such love. (<i>Turns away</i> <span class="smcap">r</span>.)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Women never do. They prefer being treated like dogs. Is it nothing
that we have met heart to heart for one sweet moment, that you have
rested a moment in my arms? To me it is a glimpse of the
unattainable heaven of love. (<i>Going up to her.</i>) Kiss me once,
Blanche, and farewell!</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>It must be for ever, then.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>coming down</i>) Let <i>me</i> speak, Constance. If there be a fault or a

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>I know my own weakness now. But I am going away, Constance&mdash;going
away out of your lives for ever. If I have sinned, I can expiate.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Expiate! A fine word, with which we drug our consciences. You have
treated me basely, cruelly, treacherously, and you <i>will expiate</i>! A
common thief can at least make restitution. Can you do that? You are
going away, taking my husband's heart with you. Can you give me that
back? I would rather you had stabbed me&mdash;killed me with one merciful
stroke.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>No, I am taking nothing with me&mdash;nothing but my own folly. I have
been the toy of your husband's imagination, that is all. To him this
has been nothing more than a passing flirtation.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>You love him, and he loves you. Don't palter with the truth.

(<i>Moves towards door.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>For God's sake, Constance, don't let us lose our heads! Let us be
just to each other. This was our fate. Call it our fault, if you
will. We have been in the grip of a strong temptation; but we have
given each other up.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>coming back</i> <span class="smcap">c</span>) Given each other up! Do you think you can
satisfy <i>me</i> with such phrases? I am to be your faithful wife, I

to dole out to me, while all your thoughts are with another woman.
It would have been more straightforward, (<i>with withering contempt</i>)
I won't say more <i>manly</i>, to have told me plainly: &quot;I cannot love

It isn't, I know. Sins that are instinctive, not of malice, lie too

<p>A fine aphorism, no doubt. How does it apply?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>You can't forgive insults that were not intended, and a &quot;low

that is what you want.</p>

put me out of conceit with love. Your chamber of horrors haunts my

like gods. But she can't. Why should we worry about it? Why ask for
cakes and ale, when sermons and soda-water are so much better for
us?</p>

<p>Will my little girl forgive mother?</p>

<p class="centre">Undine.</p>

<p>Yes, you know I'll <i>always</i> forgive you, mother. But you said I had
brought shame upon father. (<i>Going up to Denham, bursting into
indignant tears.</i>) I don't <i>want</i> to bring shame upon father!
(<i>Takes out her handkerchief, and mops her face.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>comforting her</i>) Of course not. But you know you should be
obedient to mother, Undine, and keep your promises. Then we sha'n't
be ashamed of our little girl.</p>

<p class="centre">Undine.</p>

<p>(<i>sobbing</i>) But there's no <i>use</i> promising. Oh, I <i>am</i> so tired!
(<i>Yawns.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Well, suppose you go to sleep for a while?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>She can lie on her bed, and I'll put mother's cloak over her. Would
you like that?</p>

<p class="centre">Undine.</p>

<p>(<i>sleepily</i>) Yes.</p>

<p class="centre">(<i>Mrs. Denham leads her away, the handkerchief falls on the floor.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>gets up from the table, takes his pipe, lights it, and sits down
again</i>) Everything seems torn up by the roots here. What is to
become of that monkey? She has routed her mother, horse, foot, and
dragoons,<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a> this time. Well, it's a wise mother that knows her own
daughter. (<i>Works on again.</i>) Going to drown herself! Perhaps it
would have been better if her father had hung himself long ago.
There's always that question of: To be or not to be?</p>

<p class="centre">(<i>Re-enter Mrs. Denham.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>She's asleep, Arthur.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Poor little ugly duck!</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>I suppose you think I have acted very injudiciously?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>sighing</i>) Oh, what does it matter what I think? You always act on
principle. I <i>must</i> try to get this drawing done.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Don't send me away, Arthur. You will soon be rid of me altogether.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Don't say that, dear. I know you are very miserable about
Undine&mdash;and other things. So am I. I wonder whether we are all going
mad.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>I think <i>I</i>have gone mad.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Do you say that in earnest?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>You know there was&mdash;something in our family.<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Oh, nonsense, Constance! For Heaven's sake don't brood over that.
There is something in every family, if one only inquires. Your
nerves are over-strained. I wish you'd go to bed, and let me have
some one to see you. You are looking like a ghost.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>I feel like one. But I am not going to haunt the scene of my crimes
any longer. I am going away&mdash;going away!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Well, I'm going with you, then, to take care of you. We'll send
Undine somewhere, and go abroad for a while.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Oh yes. You can be kind enough, if that were all.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Will you never make peace?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>The only peace I <i>can</i> make.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>I shall trouble you no longer.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>My dear girl, don't talk like that. It is ghastly. Constance, I must
go to Fitzgerald with this wretched drawing. I have to give some
directions about the reproduction. I sha'n't be long. Promise me
that you won't do anything foolish&mdash;that I shall find you here when
I come back.<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;you shall find me here.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>That's right. (<i>Goes to settee, and takes up shawl.</i>) And now lie
down here, and let me cover you with this shawl.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Very well. (<i>She lies down.</i>) Arthur!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes, dear.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Kiss me once before you go.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Oh, if I may! (<i>Kisses her.</i>) My poor Constance! I would give my
heart's blood to comfort you. And meanwhile I'll send you a better
thing&mdash;tea.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>Thank you, dear. You have always tried to be good to me. You could
not help being cruel, I suppose.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>I want to be good to you always. Well, good-bye, and God bless you!
(<i>Kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>God bless you! (<i>Exit Denham.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>listens for a while, then starts up</i>) He had tears in his eyes
when he kissed me. Poor Arthur! he thinks we are going to patch it
up, I suppose. I am to live on pity&mdash;a man's pity, more akin to
contempt<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a> than to love. Why <i>should</i> he love me? I was not born to
be loved, not made to be loved. And yet I wanted love so much. I
wanted all or nothing, and I have got pity&mdash;pity that puts you in a
madhouse, and comfortably leaves you to rot! Oh, my God! is this
madness&mdash;this horror of darkness that seems pressing on my brain?
(<i>A knock at the door.</i>) What's that? Come in! (<i>Enter Jane with
tea.</i>) No, not there, Jane&mdash;the small table; and bring another cup,
will you?</p>

<p class="centre">Jane.</p>

<p>Yes, m'm.</p>

<p class="centre">(<i>Jane places tea-things, and exit</i>.)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>What have I to do? Ah, yes. (<i>Sits at the table and writes
hurriedly. Re-enter Jane with a cup.</i>) Jane, take this note to Mrs.
Tremaine's at once. You know the house?</p>

<p class="centre">Jane.</p>

<p>Yes, m'm.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>giving note</i>) Take it at once.</p>

<p class="centre">Jane.</p>

<p>Yes, m'm. Was I to wait for an answer, please?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>No, Jane; no answer. (<i>Exit Jane.</i>) She will be here directly. She
<i>must</i> come&mdash;and I? Yes&mdash;yes. There is no other way of quitting the
wreck for <i>me</i>. The key? (<i>Searches her pockets.</i>) Yes! (<i>She goes
to the cupboard, opens it, and takes out a small bottle, places it
on the tea-table, and looks at it; then takes<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a> out the stopper, and
smells the poison.</i>) It smells like some terrible flower. (<i>Re-stops
and replaces the bottle.</i>) And now to arrange&mdash;to arrange it all
decently. (<i>Pushes the couch behind the screen, returns to the
table, and pours out a cup of tea.</i>) My throat is parched. (<i>Drinks
eagerly.</i>) Poor Arthur! He will be sorry&mdash;perhaps he will understand
a little now. (<i>She pours the contents of the bottle into the cup.</i>)
The Black Cat had a friend; I am not so fortunate. It is a survival
of the fittest, I suppose. The world was made for the sleek and
treacherous. (<i>She replaces the bottle in the cupboard, then
returns, and lays the keys on the table.</i>) Yes, my little Undine,
mother is tired too&mdash;so tired! Oh, sleep, sleep! If it were but
eternal sleep&mdash;if I could be <i>sure</i> I should never wake again! No
more life. And yet I want to live. Oh, my God, I want to live!
(<i>Paces to and fro, mechanically putting things in order; sees
Undine's handkerchief on the ground, and picks it up.</i>) Undine's
little handkerchief, still wet with her tears&mdash;the last human thing
on the brink of the abyss. Poor little rag; it will give me courage
to face the darkness. (<i>Kisses it, and thrusts it into her bosom,
then goes back to the table.</i>) Perhaps I <i>do</i> think too much of
things&mdash;even of death. And now! (<i>Takes up the cup and shudders.</i>)
Who said &quot;Poor Constance&quot;? (<i>Puts it down again, and presses her
hands to her ears.</i>) There are voices in my brain&mdash;voices that burn
like the flames of hell. Sleep, sleep&mdash;we must cheat the madness.
(<i>Takes the cup, and passes</i> <span class="smcap">r</span>, <i>as if to go behind
screen.</i>) How awfully things look at you when you're going to die! I
did not know this. There's Demeter with Undine's wreath of daisies<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
withered on her head. My life has withered with them, since that day
she made the libation. She forgot the speedwell for me. Mother!
Mother! Mother! This is my libation! (<i>Drinks the poison, and lets
the cup fall.</i>) It is done! (<i>She stands a moment perfectly still.</i>)
My God! not sleep, but horror! Quick! Quick! (<i>Staggers behind the
screen, and throws herself on the couch, where she is hidden from
the audience.</i>) Arthur! Arthur! Oh! save me! Arthur&mdash;oh! (<i>Moans and
dies.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">(<i>A pause, then enter Denham and Mrs. Tremaine.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Constance! I left her here on the sofa, and now&mdash;Constance! She must
have gone to her room&mdash;she sometimes does. Have some tea, won't you?</p>

<p class="centre">(<i>They approach the tea-table.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>I don't know why I have come here, I am sure. I never meant to see
this place again; and yet, here I am, like the good-natured fool I
always was.</p>

<p class="centre">(<i>He places a chair for her by the table.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>It was awfully good of you to come. That's such a strange letter for
Constance to have written. She asked you to come here at once, for
my sake and your own?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Yes. It's a mad kind of letter. (<i>She sits down.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>I am very uneasy about her.<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Well, what's that to me?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Nothing, of course. Blanche, we have been living in hell since
yesterday.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>I daresay. I have not been in Paradise, I assure you. What are you
going to do? (<i>Pours out some tea.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>puts in sugar</i>) Will she&mdash;stay with you?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>What else can she do?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>stirring her tea</i>) Then I wish you joy of the <i>m&eacute;nage</i>. You don't
seem to have gained much by making a fool of me.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>You have renewed the world for me. The mere thought of you is
sunshine. Here we have always been at loggerheads with life.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Then why&mdash;? (<i>Sips her tea.</i>) Bah! Upon my word, Arthur Denham, that
woman has drained you of your manhood like a vampire, made you the
limp coward that you are.<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Not a word against Constance, or I shall hate you, Blanche. No&mdash;I am
haunted by a ghost.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>A metaphorical one?</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>The ghost that came to Hamlet in the shape of his father&mdash;duty. It
is a trick of my British bourgeois blood, I suppose.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>What duty? To that internal Mrs. Grundy we call conscience? To the
thing called Society? To the sacred bond of marriage? Her own
principles are against you there. No&mdash;she holds you in some deeper
way than this.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>It is true&mdash;she does.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>rising</i>) Is it because you love <i>her</i> that you abandon <i>me</i>? If
so, say so; and I shall understand that I am a toy goddess, nothing
more.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>She loves me.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Ah! a woman's love can blight as terribly as a man's&mdash;almost. Well,
I like you none the worse for this curious spice of loyalty. It is
so rare in a man.<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>No&mdash;not so rare. Don't let us talk any more about it now. I think
you begin to understand. But where can she be? I seem to feel her
presence here. (<i>He looks behind the screen, then thrusts it aside,
showing Mrs. Denham lying dead on the couch.</i>) Blanche! Blanche!
Look here! Is she&mdash;?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>She has fainted&mdash;let me&mdash;!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>(<i>throws himself down beside the couch and puts his finger on her
wrist</i>) Oh my God! Dead! Dead!</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>No, no, no! It is too terrible! Let us try if&mdash; (<i>Attempts to open
dress, then recoils in horror.</i>) And I had begun to hate her&mdash;yes,
to <i>hate</i> her. My poor good Constance!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>But how&mdash;? (<i>Rising.</i>) <i>Is</i> she dead, Blanche?</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>mastering her agitation</i>) Yes, dear, dead! She has taken poison.
See here! (<i>Picks up the cup.</i>) What a horrible death! Her face is
awful!</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Oh, Constance, why did I leave you? I had a vague fear of
something&mdash;but not this! (<i>Throws himself down again, and stoops to
kiss her.</i>) Ha! Prussic acid! No help! No hope! Yet she is warm.
(<i>He starts up.</i>) Could we&mdash;? But death is a matter of seconds with
that infernal stuff. Blanche, Blanche, I have killed her!<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>I claim my share in the guilt.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>No, no. Leave me! Let the dead bury their dead!</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>If you wish me to leave you, dear, I will go.</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;for God's sake, go! (<i>She moves towards the door.</i>) But,
Blanche, don't leave the house. I can't bear this alone.</p>

<p class="centre">Mrs. Tremaine.</p>

<p>(<i>returns to him</i>) You know, dear, I am yours always. Oh, don't hate
me! I dare to say it in this presence. (<i>She kisses his hand. He
shrinks from her.</i>) Now I can go. (<i>She goes to the door and looks
back as Denham kneels and clasps the body in his arms.</i>) Will he
hate me now? (<i>Exit Mrs. Tremaine.</i>)</p>

<p class="centre">Denham.</p>

<p>Constance! I meant to have kept you from all the thorns of life! It
was fate! It was fate!</p>

<h4>IN THE GREEN PARK.</h4>

<h6>By F. NORREYS CONNELL.</h6>

<p class="centre"><span class="smcap">With Illustrations by F.H. Townsend.</span></p>

<p class="centre"><i>Crown 8vo, 3s. 6d</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Excellent fooling. Teems with classical chaff and latter-day
badinage. The chief attraction is the uninterrupted flow of
exuberant animal spirits which permeates its pages. Mr. Townsend's
illustrations to this quaint work are decidedly funny.&quot;&mdash;<i>Daily
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Full of clever and whimsical conceits. Will best be appreciated by
Londoners, and welcome to the general reader.&quot;&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Not at all a bad specimen of the New Humour.&quot;&mdash;<i>Truth.</i></p>

<p>&quot;The newest New Humour.&quot;&mdash;<i>National Observer.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Very clever. Mr. Connell's next volume is sure to be good.&quot;&mdash;<i>Black
and White.</i></p>

<p>&quot;A fantastic and amusing work. Mr. Connell is a humorist, and a
humorist of a distinctly original type. We have laughed heartily
over this book. The whole is so piquantly flavoured and seasoned.
Stories of the after-dinner type, audacious occasionally, but never
coarse, and always redeemed by a pretty and nimble art. The author
is a good fellow with his quips, and jests, and cranks; and nobody
will regret making his acquaintance.&quot;&mdash;<i>Weekly Sun.</i></p>

<h4>THE BACHELORS' CLUB.</h4>

<h6>By I. ZANGWILL.</h6>

<p class="centre"><i>Crown 8vo, 3s. 6d.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. James's Gazette</span>: &quot;Some exceedingly clever fooling, and
a happy audacity of whimsical invention.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daily Graphic</span>: &quot;A genuine humorist. We own to having
laughed heartily, and appreciated the cleverness and the cynicism.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Star</span>: &quot;Mr. Zangwill has an original way of being funny. He
is full of clever and witty, paradoxical and epigrammatical,
surprises. His book is a splendid tonic for gloomy spirits.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evening News</span>: &quot;Not one in a score of the amusing books
which come from the press is nearly so amusing as this.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunday Times</span>: &quot;Read, laugh over, and profit by the history
of 'The Bachelors' Club,' capitally told by a fresh young writer.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Globe</span>: &quot;A clever and interesting book. Agreeable satire.
Store of epigram.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The leading characters in this typically modern tale are very
well drawn, and the author has distanced all her fellow-novelists
of her own sex in the delineation of a woman whose heartlessness
may be truly called devilish. The strength of this portrait is
remarkable. The other woman is effective too, and the tangle of
the relations of the three is put right by a device of startling
originality.&quot;&mdash;<i>World.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Few cleverer books have come under our notice for many months
past.&quot;&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>&quot;A story with the one supreme merit of originality.&quot;&mdash;<i>Daily
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Another study of the New Woman, and a most brilliant and convincing
study. Celia Adair is almost an inspiration. Such a woman has never
been drawn with more absolute truthfulness.... A very powerful and
pathetic piece of work.&quot;&mdash;<i>Speaker.</i></p>

<p>&quot;A very clever story; ... it is on the crest of the wave.&quot;&mdash;<i>Review
of Reviews.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Had we space, we should like to make a good many quotations from
the sayings of Celia. Her principles are abominable, and her morals
are of the laxest; but many of her remarks are original, pungent,
and entertaining. A good deal of thought has evidently been expended
upon this book,&quot;&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<h5>THE KINDNESS OF THE CELESTIAL.</h5>

<p class="centre">By the Author of &quot;In a Canadian Canoe,&quot; etc.</p>

<p class="centre"><i>Crown</i> 8vo, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Has a quaintness and distinction of its own, an elusive quality
of style, a personal touch, that lends to it a whimsical
fascination,&quot;&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p class="centre">BY THE SAME AUTHOR.</p>

<h5>IN A CANADIAN CANOE.</h5>

<p class="centre"><i>Fourth Edition. Crown 8vo, cloth</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>&quot;The pleasant and even remarkable book which Mr. Barry Pain has
contributed to the Whitefriars Library. The best thing in the book,
to our mind, is 'The Celestial Grocery,' a quaint and thoroughly
original blending of effervescent humour with grim pathos.&quot;&mdash;<i>Pall
Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Barry Pain has a decided sense of humour. The best things in
the volume are the classical burlesques grouped under the title of
'The Nine Muses minus One.' They are really clever and full of
<i>esprit</i>.&quot;&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Nor is he deficient in fancy, and 'The Celestial Grocery' is as
whimsical as it is fresh. 'Bill' is in yet another vein, and proves
that Mr. Pain can handle the squalor of reality: while the last half
of 'The Girl and the Beetle,' the best of the book, suggests a
certain comprehension of character.&quot;&mdash;<i>National Observer.</i></p>

<p>&quot;An original worker, a man who copies no one either in treatment or
style&mdash;this, his first volume, should find a wide popularity.&quot;&mdash;<i>The
Review of Reviews.</i></p>

<p>&quot;If you want a really refreshing book, a book whose piquant savour
and quaint originality of style are good for jaded brains, buy and
read <i>In a Canadian Canoe</i>.... There is in these stories a curious
mixture of humour, insight, and pathos, with here and there a dash
of grimness and a sprinkling of that charming irrelevancy which is
of the essence of true humour. As for 'The Celestial Grocery,' I can
only say that it is in its way a masterpiece.&quot;&mdash;<i>Punch.</i></p>


<h5>STORIES AND INTERLUDES.</h5>

<p class="centre"><i>Second Edition. Crown</i> 8<i>vo, cloth</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Pain has a delicate fancy and a graceful style, a bitter-sweet
humour, and a plentiful endowment of 'the finer
perceptions.'&quot;<i>&mdash;Punch.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Amazingly clever.... Teems with satire and good
things.&quot;&mdash;<i>Speaker.</i></p>

<p>&quot;'The Magic Morning,' though dealing with a young city man and his
wife, has the atmosphere of far-away dreaminess which is so charming
in some of Nathaniel Hawthorne's short stories.&quot;&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>&quot;There is something delightfully, because unsatisfactorily,
fascinating in these stories, with their touch of <i>diablerie</i>, their
elusiveness.&quot;&mdash;<i>National Review.</i></p>

<p>&quot;If we laugh less over these pages than over the grotesque
absurdities that abounded in the former collection of sketches, we
are the more fascinated by the quiet subtlety of their humour, their
irony and pathos.&quot;&mdash;<i>Evening News and Post.</i></p>

<p>&quot;There is a great charm about these stories and
interludes.&quot;&mdash;<i>Vanity Fair.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Full of charm, fantasy, and pathos.&quot;&mdash;<i>Ladies' Pictorial.</i></p>

<p>&quot;The book as a whole is decidedly clever.&quot;&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
